# Tigase XMPP Server Command Line Management Tool

Command line application for (Tigase) XMPP Server. As the main interface connecting to a remote XMPP server is, to our big surprise XMPP protocol and more specifically  [XEP-0133](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0133.html) 

Although, specifically for Tigase other ways might be possible in the future.
